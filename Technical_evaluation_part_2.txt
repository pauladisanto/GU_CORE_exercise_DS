Technical evaluation part 2
You have 30 mins to complete this part of technical evaluation. Provide the answers as a text
file and email to marcela.davila@gu.se at the end of the allocated session. Good luck!
1. In case the time given for the practical task was not enough for you to finish, explain as
detailed as possible, what is left to do and why was not possible to complete a working
version of this script.

2. A research group has sequenced case-control vaginal swabs for both human and microbial
RNA using Illumina sequencing.
a. Describe a workflow to perform a taxonomic analysis including species abundance,
microbiome-functional pathways and correlation between human and microbial
gene expression. Justify any programs, databases and statistical tests you would use.

I do not have a experience in this specific topic but browsing a bit I found that the steps could be:

#Quality Control and trimming:

Trim adapters and low-quality bases from raw sequencing reads using tools like Cutadapt.
Perform quality assessment using FastQC to ensure sequencing data quality.
Align the reads to reference genomes using tools like Bowtie2 or BWA (for DNA aligment) for bacteria/archaea and for eukaryotes.

#Taxonomic Analysis:
Assign taxonomy to the reads using tools like QIIME 2 
Calculate species abundance using tools such as MetaPhlAn or QIIME 2.


#Microbiome-Functional Pathways:
Predict functional pathways from taxonomic data using tools like PICRUSt2, HUMAnN. 
Analyze and visualize predicted pathways using tools such as STAMP or Pathview. 

Correlation Analysis between Human and Microbial Gene Expression:
Quantify human gene expression from RNA-seq data using tools like STAR or HISAT2 (this aligners are specific for RNA aligment) and featureCounts for RNA counting.

Quantify microbial gene expression using similar methods as above for taxonomic analysis, but for microbial genomes.
Perform correlation analysis between human and microbial gene expression using tools like DESeq2 (with this library you can normalize the counts and then apply the model using one or more independet variables in order to get the information about wich genes are over expressed or under expressed).

#Integration and Visualization:

Integrate taxonomic abundance, functional pathways, and gene expression data.
Visualize the data using R tools like (ggplot2, pheatmap) to visualize the expresion of the genes.

b. Discuss any limitations we should be aware to perform this kind of analysis

Sample Variability: Vaginal microbiomes can vary significantly between individuals and even within the same individual over time. This variability can make it challenging to identify consistent patterns and correlations across samples.


RNA Instability: RNA is more susceptible to degradation compared to DNA. 

Database Limitations: Existing reference databases for taxonomic classification and functional annotation may not cover the full diversity of vaginal microbial communities or include all relevant functional pathways. 

Gene Expression Quantification: Quantifying gene expression from RNA-seq data involves several computational steps, including read alignment, normalization, and counting. Each step introduces potential sources of bias and error, which can impact the accuracy and reliability of gene expression measurements.


c. This is a heatmap you obtain showing the differentially expressed bacteria
(FDR<0.05), what are your comments to the researcher?

If I understand correctly, becuase it is not in the ususal way I see it in the heatmap form DESeq 2, but it seems that for lactobacillus cripastus (bacteria 1) in both conditions most of the genes are overexpressed.

3. You are working with 3 consulting projects. One is a differential expression analysis from microarray data. The second is the analysis of TMT data that you got from the Proteomics facility while the third is the identification of a virus integration in some clinical samples. You will be delivering the results sometime during next week, as agreed with the different users.
A fourth user got the reviewer’s comments and they need to answer back in a week, so they need your help during this week. What would you do?


I think that the clinical samples are more relevant because there is a patient that needs to be treated while the fourth person can send an email to the reviewer to get more time to answer (THIS IS NOT URGENT). 


4. During a first meeting consultation, the analysis that the group is asking you to do is quite
new and you haven’t performed it before. As usual, they need results in as soon as possible
for a grant application. What would you do?


The fisrt thing is to check of there is a workflow available on internet (in general there is a lot of tutorials about different types of analysis). If I could not find any workflow I could ask my partners if someone has worked with something similar and ask for help to do the required analisys.


5. After having delivered the final results to a user, you are contacted by the PI saying that the results you delivered do not make sense. You check them and you realize you made a mistake in one of the calculations. What would you do?

I would report the mistake. Bioinformaticians are humans and sometimes they make mistakes.
